## About

The contents of this website are based on the PhD thesis entitled "Regression Modelling with Priors using Fisher Information Covariance Kernels (I-priors)" by Haziq Jamil. It is intended as an accompaniment to the research poster of the same title.

This project was supervised by [Wicher Bergsma](http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchandexpertise/experts/profile.aspx?KeyValue=w.p.bergsma%40lse.ac.uk) and [Irini Moustaki](http://stats.lse.ac.uk/moustaki/).

## Author

Haziq Jamil is a research student in Statistics at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
His interests are in statistical methodology and computation, with an emphasis on applications towards social science.

Haziq graduated with first class honours from The University of Warwick in 2010, where he read Mathematics, Operational Research, Statistics and Economics. He completed an MSc in Statistics with distinction at the London School of Economics and Political Science in 2014. He is expected to complete his PhD from the same university in 2018.

Previously, Haziq worked as a research officer at the Centre of Science and Technology, Research and Development at the Ministry of Defence, Brunei, where he gave decision support for strategic acquisition projects.
